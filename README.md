# personal-website

The purpose for this website was to have somewhere to track all my activities throughout my studies, it's turned into more than that now, but is still quite unorganised.

Update  - 28/03/2022

I have unfortunately not had enough time during my studies to be able to focus on updating the website. It was last updated around 3 years ago, this was when I had not started my computing course, but then the pandemic hit and I was only focusing on my university work. 

When I have completed my university course, I hope to completely redesign this website to make it much more user friendly and dynamic, adapting to both laptop and mobile users. There isn't a specific aim for the website other than to showcase my skills. 

My final year project for my university course consists of a consolidation software for multiple daily changing excel spreadsheets to result in specific set of data for picking and packing to send to customers, this is directly related to my current job. 

I currently work as a service engineer, testing and evaluating products that come to the department to prepare them for resale. This position has given me an insight into the hardware side of computing while still giving me the opportunity to develop my software skills by developing methods of analysis.

changelog

06/07/2019 - Update 20
Updated more pages, added a page for Esme. Tried out a parallax page on there, looks pretty good, helps that we have some good pictures as well. Have no ideas for a new game, hopefully working with Java and python will improve that. Plus September will provide me with new skills as well. Haven't sorted through the pages because I've been working on the other website. 

15/02/2019 - update 18
Updated more pages, switched all files to the new domain and created "redirect" page for roadtopharmacology. Added the differentiation of the two BSc degrees, computing and biomedical science. It can't all go in one place can it? No is the answer. I'm glad no one else will read this. Future updates to include further sorting of pages and more updates to my game, including a retitle, it can't be called road to pharmacology any more that's for sure. Maybe I'll create a new game, need an idea first though.

04/02/2019
Updated several Biomed pages to show the correct links on the right selection menu, and also titles in cascading menu and page title. Added update to the main Bsc page explaining about the change in course. Future updates to include section creation of Computing and Biomed courses.

01/02/2019
Added "update 17" to index.html. Need to switch files from roadtopharmacology.com to paulgcadams.me. (will need to make the new site name in index.html a link)
