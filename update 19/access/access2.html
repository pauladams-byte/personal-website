<h1>Access course home</h1>
<div>
<p style= "border:50px white; font-size:20px;">2017, the start of my journey. I started an access to science course following on from completing Functional skills in english. The fact was that I knew I had a lot of work coming up, during the college course I was also working full time, this took a toll on me, but it is what it is, and I know/ knew it would all be worth it in the end. Around the middle of January I started writing this very website (the Mole being the first page I was completely happy with).<br>
<br>
  Knowing of course, I didn't have that much spare time as it was, probably not my greatest idea to be starting brand new project. Especially writing a website from scratch.<br>
  <br>
  This at least at the moment, is my favourite time to be studying. I am busy almost all the time which is of course a lot to handle. Sometimes I had doubts about if I can do this at all. Luckily, I have had great people around me, my friends both at work and at college not to mention my family supporting in any way they can.<br> </p></div>
