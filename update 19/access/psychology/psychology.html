  <h1>Paul Adams</h1>
  <p class="title">Creator & designer</p>
  <p>Bournemouth and Poole College</p>
  <p>In the short term, I plan on completing my the access course and gaining a place to university. In the long term I hope to gain a masters, and PhD in Phamacological sciences. My experience with technology and creating this website provides the skills I need to "get a foot in the door". With technology moving so quickly, scientists in any field, need to have the ability to quickly shift and learn new techniques of investigation. With this in mind, I hope to go further in exploring Pharmacoinformatics being the study of pharmacology and computational systems of the future.</p>
  <p>I have experience in working in Bars and restaurants which helped develop my "people" skills. Along with my position held as an SME for a large technological company supporting mobile devices, have also given me skills to get me ready for the challenges of university. This has also given me the opportunity to develop this website and Google Chrome Extensions.</p></div>

  <h1>Psychodynamic</h1>

<p>Psychodynamic is the approach created by Sigmund Freud, often known as the Freudian approach. Sigmund Freud proposed that consciousness has separate competing parts. Whatever part pf the consciousness is dominant at any time = directly influences our observable behaviour. </p>

<p>He suggested 6 levels of the mind:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Conscious</th>
			<th>Preconscious</th>
			<th>Unconscious</th>
			<th>ID</th>
			<th>Superego</th>
			<th>EGO</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Aware of an responding to our own surroundings.</td>
			<td>Of or associated with a part of the mind below the level of immediate conscious awareness, from which memories and emotions that have been repressed can be recalled.</td>
			<td>Not awake and aware of and responding to own environment, the opposite of consciousness.</td>
			<td>"Pleasure principle"<br>The personality component made up of unconscious psychic energy that works to ssatisfy basic urges, needs and desires.</td>
			<td>"Morality principle"<br>The component of personality composed of our internalized ideals that we have acquired from our parents and society.</td>
			<td>"Reality principle"<br>The component of the peronality that is represented by our conscious decision making process.</td>

OCD<br>
Panic Disorder<br>
Post-traumatic stress disorder<br>
Acute stress disorder</p>
<p>Anxiety symptoms, only become a disorder when it starts affecting the patients personal life.</p>
<p>Comorbidity is a situation in which a sufferer has one condition which meets requirements for other disorders as well, or where there are similarities between the symptoms of 2 different disorders.<br>
	The GP has to choose/ decide what disorder the sufferer has.</p>
<p>There is often comorbidity between anxiety disorders because<br>Most anxiety disorders share the same symptoms (Racing heart, perspiration etc)<br>
The causes may be the same for each disorder. Anxious people may start "collecting" disorders resulting in a snowball effect.</p>
<p>Is there comorbidity between anxiety and other disorders?<br><br>
Illness anxiety disorder/ Hypochondriasm - Somataphormic "of the body"<br>
Conversion Disoders - Hysteria, Anna O and Freud<br>
Avoidant personality disorders - avoiding situations which results in avoiding that situation for the rest of your life.<br>
Substance abuse - Essay subject, if you are anxious you may need to be taking the substance in order to calm yourself down.<br>
Eating disorders<br>
Sleep disorders<br>
Depression<br>
Hoarding - keeping possessions, letting them go will cause anxiety<br>
Trichotillomania - compulsive hair pulling<br>

Types of depression:<br><br>

Uni-polar depression<br>
Post partum depression<br>
dysthymic disorder<br>
Bi-polar depression<br>
SAD - seasonal affective depression<br>
Cyclothymic disorder<br><br>

What causes depression?<br><br>
Genetics<br>
Serotonin deficit<br>
Noradrenaline deficit<br>
Low frontal lobe activity<br><br>
Are these related, and which caused the other?<br><br>

Could diet affect cause depression?<br><br>
Foods containing Triptophan can improve your mood.<br><br>
Could hormones affect your mood and cause depression? (Biological)<br><br>
Cortisol excess<br>
Thyroxin deficit<br>
Oxytocin deficit<br>
Melatonin excess<br>
Estrogen loss<br><br>

Psychological causes depression<br><br>

Loss<br>
0-2 - belonging/trust - dependency fixation, the vulnerability of loss experienced causes the depression which is the anger at the loss turned on oneself.<br>
Lack of positive reinforcement<br>
Negative cognitions<br>
Hopelessness<br>
Lack of self regard<br><br>

Biopsychosocial model.<br><br>
Looking at all three "approaches" is important, as each person is individual to themselves. There could potentially be multiple causes, and therefore the best treatment is not necessarily one or the other therapies or drugs.

<p>	Schizophrenia was classified as a mental illness by blueler in 1911. It's one of the most severe illnesses in history.
	It is essentially the mind splitting, where the "Brain is no longer talking to each other". Sarbin (1992) however argued that Schizophrenia is a syndrome. A syndrome is a collection of symptoms not clearly fitting into any one disorder.

<p>To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, you "have" to suffer with symptoms for 6 months. It gives the opportunity for drugs to leave the system that could be causing the symptoms.<br><br>Hallucinations are seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or feeling something that others cannot detect. These are one of the more severe symptoms of schizophrenia. It can be a somatosensory experience, which is actually feeling the hallucination an believing it is real. 75% of schizophrenia sufferers get hallucinations.
</p>
<p>Delusions are where a person cannot tell what is real from what is imagined. It is another severe symptom of schizophrenia. Some people may believe something which isn't true, they aren't able to tell the difference. 70% of schizophrenic patients have delusions.
<br><br>
25% of schizophrenic patients will never recover, and 25% can recover. 50% are functional, and don't need medication or get along with it. "Revolving door" patients, they are never fully recovered, but never fully ill either.
</p>
<p>Are there different types?<br><br>
Yes and no, the UK now has a sliding scale rather than categorising. America however, has got categories.<br>

<h1>Eating disorders</h1>
<p>What eating disorders are there?
	<br>Bulimia Nervosa
	<br>Diabilimia
	<br>Binge eating disorder
	<br>Nocturnal binge eating disorder
	<br>Prader Willi syndrome
	<br>Pica<br>
	Bulimia is more about overeating.<br><br>
	Anorexia Nervosa<br>
	Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
	<br>Vomiting (associated with other psychological disturbances).
	<br>Anorexia is more about avoiding food.<br><br>

	<br>What are the symptoms of eating disorders?<br><br>

	Binge eating - Both anorexia and bulimia<br>
	Weight loss - Anorexia <br>
	Anxiety - Anorexia <br>
	Purging - Both<br>
	Depression - Bulimia<br>
	Secretive/ avoidant - Both<br>
	Perfectionist tendencies - Anorexia<br>
	Loss of menstruation - Anorexia<br>
	Lethargy - Anorexia<br>
	Excessive exercise - Both<br>
	Fasting - Anorexia<br>
	Impulsive - Bulimia<br>

	<br>What are the causes of Anorexia? <br><br>

	Biological factors that might cause Anorexia<br><br>
	Genetic inheritance<br>
	5HT2 receptor fault<br>
	Immune system defect<br>
	Brain Damage<br>
	Premature Birth<br><br>

	The Serotonin 5HT2, could have caused anorexia, but it could also be that the anorexia is causing the 5HT2 damage.
	<br>There is a large question that asks what is the cause, and what is the effect. Similar to what came first, the egg or the chicken. This is a common kind of question that scientists want to find the answer to it.<br>
	<br>Other factors may be causing Anorexia Nervosa<br>
	Social media pressures<br>
	Social rewards<br>
	Family pressure<br>
	Bullying<br>
	Personality type<br>
	Cognitive distortions<br>
	<br>When explaining a cause, use a theorist, link it to a perspective/ approach, and identify what research it is based on.<br>


	<br>What are the treatments for Anorexia?<br>
	5HT2 receptor fault -----> Drugs
	Brain Damage -----> Drugs
	Starvation effects -----> Enforced diet change<br>
	Cognitive dysfunction -----> CBT<br>
	Family Stress -----> Family therapy<br>
	
	<br>When outlining a therapy identify origins, the principles they are based on, and the stages & length of treatment.<br>
	<br>And finally Evaluate, make sure to include the pro's and con's of the therapies.

 List different types and symptoms of PD<br><br>

 What is meant by 'personality'?<br>
 Freud brought personalities to the world. He said that you are not born with them. He said that you can change personalities, focusing on the Ego to make it stronger. A dysfunctional adult would be from a fixation "being stuck" with that fixation.<br><br>

Personality = Unique characteristics<br><br>
Thoughts - Feelings - Behaviour<br><br>

Extrovert - very loud, outgoing, fun<br>
Introvert - Quiet, reclusive<br>

Predictable patterns/ responses<br>
Relatively permanent characteristics<br>
Resistant to environmental influences<br><br>

"Traits"<br><br>
When to these traits become a 'personaility disorder'?<br><br>
Thoughts - Feelings - Behaviour<br><br>
When the traits deviate from the sovial norms<br>
When the traits differ from statistical average<br>
when the behaviours distress self/others<br>
When the traits effect relationships negatively<br><br>

Personality Disorders:<br><br>
A group of disorders chracterised by maladaptive or inflexible ways of dealing with orders and one's environment.</p>
