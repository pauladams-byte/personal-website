  <div class="info"><h3>Renewable energy source - Gorse</h3><p>The Common Gorse is mainly known for its ability to burn hot and rapidly. It was used across Britain to heat ovens for baking since it produces little ash. Gorse can be identified by its yellow flowers with an aroma of coconut and prickles, which are useful for warding off herbivores while it grows naturally as it is highly nutritious. In the 19th Century Gorse mills were common to grind it down for farmers to feed to horses and cattle (Green, 2014).</p></div>

  <h3>Survival - Oak Tree</h3>
  <p>The Oak tree has a variety of uses, all parts of the tree are edible giving it a viable resource in the wild. While it is indeed wholey edible, some parts become bitter, for example the acorns on the tree are easily eaten, you would need to strip the shell and soak them in water for 1-2 days to remove the bitter taste which is tannin (tannic acid). You can also boil or grind them into flour for baking. The wood can be used for building such as tables and wardrobes, it can also be cut into thin strips for weaving into baskets or mats (Wilderness Arena, 2012).</p></div>

  <div class="info"><h3>Pollution control - Willow Tree</h3>
  <p>The willow tree is able to decontaminate soil as a study completed in Finland found that using the Willow tree and other broad-leaved trees, it is possible to decontaminate and purify the soil. The areas used were once used for mining or as a landfill and contained many harmful substances. Since the willow tree can grow in soil with a high acidity (pH 3.7-4) it was useful for this study. It is even believed that the willow will clean different metals in 10-50 years (ScienceDaily, 2014).</p>
