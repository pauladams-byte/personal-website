  <p>In the short term, I plan on completing my the access course and gaining a place to university. In the long term I hope to gain a masters, and PhD in Phamacological sciences. My experience with technology and creating this website provides the skills I need to "get a foot in the door". With technology moving so quickly, scientists in any field, need to have the ability to quickly shift and learn new techniques of investigation. With this in mind, I hope to go further in exploring Pharmacoinformatics being the study of pharmacology and computational systems of the future.</p>
  <p>I have experience in working in Bars and restaurants which helped develop my "people" skills. Along with my position held as an SME for a large technological company supporting mobile devices, have also given me skills to get me ready for the challenges of university. This has also given me the opportunity to develop this website and Google Chrome Extensions.</p>

<p>2017, the start of my journey. I started an access to science course following on from completing Functional skills in english. The fact was that I knew I had a lot of work coming up, during the college course I was also working full time, this took a toll on me, but it is what it is, and I know/ knew it would all be worth it in the end. Around the middle of January I started writing this very website (the Mole being the first page I was completely happy with).<br>
<br>
  Knowing of course, I didn't have that much spare time as it was, probably not my greatest idea to be starting a brand new project. Especially writing a website from scratch.<br>
  <br>
At the moment, this is my favourite time to be studying. I am busy almost all the time which is of course a lot to handle. Sometimes I had doubts about if I can do this at all. Luckily, I have had great people around me, my friends both at work and at college not to mention my family supporting in any way they can.<br> </p>
